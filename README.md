## üìÑ Introduction

This project focuses on exploring **customer purchasing behavior** across various stores. The analysis examines how factors like **promotions**, **holidays**, and **store openings** impact purchasing patterns. Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, we will clean the data, visualize key trends, and provide insights to improve business strategies.

## üéØ Goals

The main goal is to explore customer behavior and understand how different factors such as promotions and competitor proximity influence store sales. The analysis will guide decisions for optimizing **promotional strategies** and increasing **sales growth**.

### Key Objectives:
- **Promo Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of promotions between training and test datasets.
- **Holiday Sales Behavior:** Evaluate how sales change before, during, and after holidays.
- **Seasonal Purchase Behavior:** Detect patterns around key seasonal events (e.g., Christmas, Easter).
- **Sales vs. Customers:** Study the correlation between sales numbers and customer counts.
- **Promotion Effectiveness:** Analyze how promotions affect sales and customer influx.
- **Promo Deployment:** Identify which stores should prioritize promotions to achieve better results.
- **Store Opening/Closing Trends:** Analyze customer behavior around store opening and closing times.
- **Weekday vs. Weekend Sales:** Compare how sales perform on weekends for stores open on weekdays.
- **Assortment Type Impact:** Study the effect of product assortment on sales.
- **Competitor Proximity:** Understand how competitor distance affects store performance.
- **New Competitor Impact:** Analyze how new competitor openings influence existing store sales.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The data cleaning process ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis. It involves:
- **Handling missing data** to avoid biased insights.
- **Detecting and addressing outliers** to ensure clean data.
- **Data transformation and feature engineering** for better analysis.

## üîç Exploratory Questions

The analysis will address the following key questions through visualizations and summary tables:

1. **Promo Distribution:** Are promotions similarly distributed between training and test sets?
2. **Holiday Sales Behavior:** How do sales perform before, during, and after major holidays?
3. **Seasonal Patterns:** Are there specific seasonal purchase patterns during holidays like Christmas or Easter?
4. **Sales vs. Customers:** What is the relationship between sales figures and customer numbers?
5. **Promo Effectiveness:** How do promotions impact both new and existing customers?
6. **Promo Optimization:** How can promotions be better deployed to maximize results? Which stores should focus more on promotions?
7. **Store Opening/Closing:** How does customer behavior vary during store opening and closing times?
8. **Weekday vs. Weekend Sales:** How do stores open on all weekdays perform on weekends?
9. **Assortment Impact:** How does the type of assortment affect sales?
10. **Competitor Distance:** How does competitor proximity influence store sales, especially in city centers?
11. **New Competitors:** What is the impact of new competitor store openings on existing stores?

## üìä Visualizations

Key findings will be communicated through the following visualizations:
- **Histograms** and **density plots** for distribution analysis.
- **Time series plots** to explore trends across different periods (e.g., holidays, promotions).
- **Heatmaps** to analyze correlations (e.g., sales vs. customers).
- **Scatter plots** and **bar charts** for competitor and assortment analysis.

## üìù Logging

For traceability and reproducibility, we will log all key steps in the analysis using the **Python `logging` library**. This ensures that every step is recorded, and the workflow can be easily tracked and debugged.
